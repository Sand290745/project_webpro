                'content' => '<div>October 25, 2021<br><br>&nbsp;Arguably one of the biggest groups in K-Pop today,<strong> EXO</strong> has been on the scene since 2012 and has had their fair share of struggles in that time. Long time fans of the group will remember the early days and how quickly the group dynamic and concepts shifted to bring us to the present. EXO’s story is a long and arduous road, one that has defined the group’s journey to success.<br><br><br><br></div><h1>Two Moons: EXO-M and EXO-K</h1><div>&nbsp;EXO began as a twelve member group split down the middle: <strong>EXO-K</strong> was to focus on promotion in Korea while <strong>EXO-M</strong> focused on China. The four original Chinese members <strong>Kris</strong>, <strong>Luhan</strong>, <strong>Tao</strong> and <strong>Lay</strong>, alongside <strong>Chen</strong> and <strong>Xiumin</strong>, made up EXO-M, while leader <strong>Suho</strong>, <strong>Sehun</strong>, <strong>Kai</strong>, <strong>Baekhyun</strong>, <strong>D.O.</strong> and <strong>Chanyeol</strong> represented EXO-K. The members were introduced through a series of short teaser films, most of which were accompanied by early, not yet complete versions of songs that would later be released on their albums.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>&nbsp;The group pre-released mini-album tracks “History” and “What Is Love,” but the full depth of their debut concept was fully showcased when they finally appeared on the scene with “Mama,” a debut track this is particularly notorious in the K-Pop community not only for its extremely long and eccentric story-heavy opening, but for the dark and chanting rhythm that began the song itself. To sum up the intro of the video, it basically just explains the concept of each member of EXO having a special superpower, with the group split into two different factions. Yes, EXO began their career on the basis of having superpowers. There’s no question that “Mama” left a long-lasting impression, especially since the choice of a darker, more story-heavy concept to begin their career with was considered more unusual than it is today.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;While the split groups found success in their target markets, with EXO-K peaking at No.1 on the <strong>Gaon Albums Chart</strong> and EXO-M peaking at No.2 on the <strong>Sina Albums Chart</strong>, the decision to bring the members back together as a whole was made in 2013, and EXO made their first comeback with first studio album <em>XOXO</em> and lead title “Wolf.” The track got the group their first music show win on <em>Music Bank</em>. Two months later, the repackage of <em>XOXO</em> was released with lead title “Growl,” the song largely credited with bringing EXO their commercial success. This repackage also helped push <em>XOXO</em> over a million sales, which made the group the first South Korean act to reach that milestone in 12 years. In December of that year, EXO released their first Winter album <em>Miracles in December</em>. On top of that, EXO took home a slew of awards during the 2013 year-end awards, including “Song of the Year” at the <em>Melon Music Awards</em>, “Disc Daesang” at the <em>Golden Disc Awards</em>, and “Album of the Year” at <em>MAMA</em>. Just a year and a half into their career, and EXO were already a household name.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><h1>Present Day&nbsp;</h1><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As we bring EXO’s story to the present, the group as a whole has split off due to looming military enlistments, as often happens with seasoned groups. While Xiumin hit the age limit and was required to enlist, surprisingly, younger member D.O. also chose to enlist this year, a few years earlier than his cutoff. Chen and Baekhyun each debuted solo, while Sehun and Chanyeol debuted as duo <strong>EXO-SC</strong>. Members have also branched off into drama and variety show appearances. EXO is poised to come back on November 27, though they will be missing the two vocalists in the military as well as Chinese member Lay, so it remains to be seen how the album will turn out with three members, including a main vocalist, absent from the release.<br><br></div><div><br>Despite some setbacks early on in their career and the loss of three members, EXO’s momentum hasn’t slowed down one bit as their career heads to the hiatus period for the military. With many achievements under their belt both domestically and internationally, it’s not hard to see why this group is so popular the world over. <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;source: <a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2019/11/24/history-of-k-pop-exo">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2019/11/24/history-of-k-pop-exo</a><br><br></div>',

Titled <em>공감 (Empathy)</em>, D.O. debuts his first mini-album with a total of eight songs that are soothing and heartfelt. Fans have been waiting far and wide for the EXO member to finally make his debut, and he does not disappoint with a stunning acoustic R&amp;B mini-album.&nbsp;<br><br> Tracklist: &nbsp;</div><ol><li>&nbsp;Rose</li><li>&nbsp;I’m Gonna Love You (featuring <strong>Wonstein</strong>)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;My Love&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;It’s Love&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Dad &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;I’m Fine &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Rose (English Version) &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Si Fueras Mía*&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br><br></div><h1>“Rose”</h1><div><br>It’s spring in the season of summer as D.O. introduces “Rose” as his title track. “Rose” is an acoustic ballad that is sweet and warm, and expresses that butterfly-in-your-stomach feeling of being in love and experiencing that thrilling and happy emotion. Throughout the song, D.O. has his crush running through his mind, and wonders how he can relay these feelings to them. Just like a rose budding, so do his feelings begin to bloom more and more as they continue to grow in his heart. But he also equates the beauty of his crush to a rose as well, noting it several times throughout the song. “Rose” is a definite love letter to his crush and his wanting to convey these sweet feelings, hoping that they’ll get across somehow.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>The music video for “Rose” is just as sweet and quirky as the song, featuring D.O. happily going about his day as he spends his time thinking about his crush. Ignorance, in this case throughout the music video, is truly bliss. As he is in his own happy bubble, D.O. either narrowly misses—or doesn’t see—the mishaps and mayhem that follow behind him. Despite all that is going on, his feelings for his blooming crush are what really get him through the day and protect him. It can also be interpreted that moments, like the fire hydrant or lights exploding that look like fireworks, are the moments that represent his heart bursting with love and joy as his crush crosses his mind. It’s truly a sweet music video that is sure to bring a smile to many.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_btxV8tJM7w">D.O. 디오 \'Rose\' MV</a></h1><div><br><br></div><div><br>Overall, D.O. makes a solid solo debut that brings out that tingly and fluttery feeling of love throughout the album. Many can surely empathize with the themes of love that are portrayed in <em>공감 (Empathy)</em>, which is perfectly titled. There are a load of great B-side tracks as well. From the touching “Dad” and “I’m Gonna Love You” featuring Wonstein to the Spanish track “Si Fueras Mía” (which translates to “if you were mine” in English), D.O. delivers a delight of an album that is well worth the listen.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><br>&nbsp;source: <a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/7/28/do-makes-highly-anticipated-debut-with-empathy">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/7/28/do-makes-highly-anticipated-debut-with-empathy</a></div><div><br></div>',

            'content' => '<div>&nbsp;March 15, 2021 <br><br>&nbsp;It’s been a long time coming for <strong>Rosé</strong> but she has finally made her long-awaited solo debut. As the next <strong>BLACKPINK</strong> member to make their solo debut, Rosé serves fans worldwide with an ethereal and stunning single album. Despite only two songs on the album, instantaneously the girl group member has captured the hearts of many. Another bonus is that the entire single album is sung in English. &nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>“On The Ground”</h1><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“What goes up must come down,” says Rosé in her debut single that is centered around coming back to reality and down to earth. “On The Ground” illustrates that the glitz and glam is not exactly what it seems to be. This alternative pop song dives into how she has worked so hard and gained so much to be in the position where she is now. However, it can be a lonely, fake, and cold road at the top. After a lot of reflecting, the realization of everything she needs is back on the ground. While the song has a dark edge to it, “On The Ground” is catchy and addictive thanks to the experimental use of electro and synth with pop influences. It’s quite the departure from her usual cute and bubbly persona that many are used to seeing when doing activities with her bandmates.&nbsp; <br><br><br> The music video, in true BLACKPINK style, has a heavy emphasis on the fashion and the visuals. While there is no choreography shown in the music video, it’s the elements of things falling (such as a chandelier and meteor speeding out of the sky) and Rosé’s multiple stages of herself that drive the meaning of coming back down to earth. Whether it be the version of herself that is above the clouds and in the mix of fame and fortune or the at-home casual wear, the silver lining comes when Rosé finds the balance between both worlds and centers herself in the end. With its sobering yet humbling feeling, the theme of never forgetting one’s roots and where one comes from makes this music video so good. &nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>“Gone”</h1><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Sticking straight to her acoustic roots, “Gone” is the quintessential heartbreak song that, despite it’s sad themes, will get listeners hooked to the acoustics. Dealing with heartbreak is never an easy thing to do and “Gone” is the perfect example of the emptiness that comes after a break up. It seems that Rosé is on the short end of the stick in this relationship, seeing how her lover is over the relationship even though she doesn’t want to let it go. With her former lover walking away with their love, the lyrics “all my love is dead and gone” have never hit as hard until now. As much as she tries to reach out and refuses to believe that her former lover chose to leave her with a broken heart, the pain is evident with how she was left used and played. Although there is no music video for the song, fans were treated to a preview video that was released prior to the drop of her single, begging for the full release of the video to happen.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;Rosé stuns with her debut single and brings the artist to a brand new edge that many have been waiting for. As a debut, Rosé delivered a solid single album and there is hope that there is another opportunity in the future that she or the other members will have their moment to shine with another solo release. <br><br><br>&nbsp;source: <a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/15/ros-makes-her-solo-debut-with-r">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/15/ros-makes-her-solo-debut-with-r</a><br><br></div>',

            'content' => '<div>&nbsp;September 19, 2021 <br><br>&nbsp;All <strong>NCT</strong> units have been reaching new heights, constantly breaking <strong>SM Entertainment</strong>\'s records as well as their own this year. 2021 is clearly their year, and <strong>NCT 127</strong>’s third album didn’t flop either when it comes to numbers. But is <em>Sticker</em> actually that good? Well let’s just say it caused a little “Kraze” in our editorial chat on the day of the release, and we ended up agreeing that yes, the overall album slaps. So keep reading, it gets better.&nbsp;<br><br> Tracklist:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>&nbsp;Sticker&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Lemonade</li><li>&nbsp;Breakfast</li><li>&nbsp;Focus&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;The Rainy Night&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Far&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Bring The Noize</li><li>&nbsp;Magic Carpet Ride&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Road Trip</li><li>&nbsp;Dreamer</li><li>&nbsp;Promise You</li></ol><div><br>&nbsp;NCTzens have been spoiled lately with so much great content. But I did have my Miranda Priestly moment when NCIT first popped up during the teaser weeks—a school concept? For September? Groundbreaking. We definitely see no back-to-school campaigns anywhere this time of year. But following that initial thought, now I actually want more “Neo Culture Institute of Technology” in my life. <em>NCIT HOUSE</em>&nbsp; is definitely one of the most entertaining new sitcoms this year, and those <em>Seoul City</em> teaser photos...I can’t move on. <br><br><br> After 1.5 years of waiting, and an ocean of quality content, NCT 127 is finally back with their third studio album filled with mature and empowering thoughts, confidence, and cool hip-hop, R&amp;B, and dance tracks—spiced up with a little wanderlust and longing to meet again. Somehow as they start growing bigger and bigger, <strong>Taeil</strong>, <strong>Johnny</strong>, <strong>Taeyong</strong>, <strong>Doyoung</strong>, <strong>Yuta</strong>, <strong>Jaehyun</strong>, <strong>Jungwoo</strong>, <strong>Mark</strong>, and <strong>Haechan</strong> just start to feel closer and closer with their constantly maturing, evolving, and growing music.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1><em>Sticker</em>&nbsp; in Numbers</h1><div><br>&nbsp;11 songs, 38 minutes, and 46 seconds. Okay, these are not the numbers I meant—although if you look at the release date, September 17, 2021, it resonates 1-2-7 pretty well. But here’s the real deal: the high anticipation for the long-awaited album was proved by pre-sale numbers and first day achievements. <em>Sticker</em> broke the record for SM Entertainment’s first day pre-orders, and received a total of 2.12 million pre-orders, which is the highest ever in the company’s history. They went on to break their own highest first-week sales on <strong>HANTEO</strong> within less than a day. <br><br><br> On the day of release, the album reached No. 1 in over a dozen countries, debuted at No. 2 on <strong>iTunes Worldwide</strong>, and had over 4.5 million streams on <strong>Spotify</strong>, breaking another SM Entertainment record for 2021. The complete album took over local charts with all 11 songs! Both on the day of its release and the day after, <em>Sticker</em> got an “all kill” on <strong>MelOn</strong>, taking the first 11 spots with their 11 new songs that also all made it to top 30 on <strong>FLO</strong>. <br><br><br> Of course, the anticipation and great visual teasers drove all NCTzens to the music video right away. It surpassed 1,000,000 views in 21 minutes, becoming the fastest SM Entertainment music video to reach that milestone. In the first 24 hours, “Sticker” reached over 27 million views on YouTube, taking a good second place between <strong>NCT Dream</strong>’s “Hot Sauce” and <strong>NCT U</strong>’s “Make A Wish” on the list of most viewed SM Entertainment music videos on the first day. NCT clearly dominates the company currently.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Title Track: “Sticker”</h1><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I think “Sticker” would have been a really strong B-side, but as a title track...I’m not convinced just yet. It’s a hip-hop based rhythmic dance song with a strong baseline and a flute sound that is way too overpowering at the intro. It’s definitely energetic, but also aims to be powerful and a bit sexy. I don’t think “Sticker” leaves room for the members to fully show themselves, though they even said they wanted to show their colors through this song, which feels like something is missing. Meanwhile, some parts simply felt out of place to me. I don\'t want to specify them because I don’t want anyone to associate this comment with any of the members, I’m just not a fan of the arrangement at some points, even though I usually enjoy the works of the producers behind it. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;I did listen to it on repeat for the sake of this review, and it slowly started to stick to me, so it might be just one of those songs that takes a little time and getting used to before completely growing on you. That being said, I did enjoy the lyrics right away, and I was really glad when I found out that Taeyong and Mark contributed to them. “Sticker” is about how relying on someone, like stickers stuck together, can make a complicated world better. It’s more sweet rather than powerful in contrast to what it seems to be aiming for, but it works. Sticking together and us being the main characters in their “masterpiece," and although there is nothing new in the metaphor, “Talk about your gravity, you pull me so hard like crazy,” I like it. It\'s often used because it simply works.<br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Music Video</h1><div><br>&nbsp;This could easily just be me lacking something, but while I\'m 99% sure the song will grow on me, I just don’t understand the “Sticker” music video, even after several watches. To be honest, it felt a bit like a showcase of NCT’s music club’s year-end project—very high budget sets for a school performance though!&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;It was surprising how overpowering the (still neo-futuristic, of course) wild west was in this concept. Like besides the, “Bang bang look at the kids holding their heads up high / NCT we will show you the vibe, hi / Our logo in the shape of a gun,” part that only comes up once in the first verse, I just couldn’t find the connection. If we want to force it, the, “Don\'t say much other than\'I love you\' / If I\'m right, throw your hands up,” part could have been portrayed as a gunfight out of a Western movie where one ends up giving up, confessing and saying “I love you” by holding up their hands, but that wasn’t the case. That random cowboy-dressed dog deserves some brownie points for the cuteness though. What saves this music video is the styling; their outfits, hair, and makeup all slapped! But definitely check it out and decide for yourself. It’s a very subjective topic, and the music video could very much be your cup of tea.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oYWnbTSang">NCT 127 엔시티 127 \'Sticker\' MV</a></h1><div><br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Album: <em>STICKER</em></h1><div><br><br></div><div><strong>”Lemonade”<br><br></strong>&nbsp;Now the second track on the album, “Lemonade,” is what I’m talking about. It feels like what I thought <em>Sticker</em> was going to be like when I first saw the teaser photos. I have a feeling if NCT 127 pulled an <strong>ATEEZ</strong> and made fans vote for the official title between “Lemonade” and “Sticker,” this might have been the winner. The track video already felt more powerful and sexy than just a plain lemonade. &nbsp;</div><div><br>&nbsp;“Lemonade” is also a hip-hop based dance track with more of a minimal drop and bass sound. It feels addictive and empowering from the beginning, though the last chorus is the highlight for me. Jaehyun dominates this song, and I really enjoy the contrast between Haechan and Yuta’s voices. But of course Taeyong’s rap hits the spot as always, just like all the other members.<br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;Now what makes it extra attractive is actually the lyrics. It’s sexy but not in a sexual way; its confident attitude will make you feel all kinds of ways. It’s basically about when life gives you lemons…you know the drill. The lyrics talk about not dealing with life’s sourness (and haters’ BS), ignoring these noises, and enjoying life to its full sweetness. Mark also mentions previous tracks “Fire Truck,” “Cherry Bomb,” and “Irregular” in the second verse, giving “Lemonade” another reason to become a fan-favorite—not that it needed any more push, as it actually debuted at No. 4 on <strong>Spotify Korea</strong>.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br>And The Other B-Sides<br><br></strong>&nbsp;“Breakfast” is a bit more pulsing than the previous two songs. It’s an uptempo electronic future house track. But don’t let the title fool you, it’s not about an innocent morning feast, more like about the night before and staying together until the morning—filled with an excitement and yearning that lasts through each part of the day. I’ve been blushing from the first listen, and I’m blushing again as I\'m writing this. Seems like I can’t get used to these feelings even after having the song on repeat all day. <br><br>&nbsp;Following the powerful start to the album, there are two melodic songs that let the members show off more of their vocal capabilities. “Focus” is a groovy R&amp;B track that also feels quite sensual. Its original title “같은 시선,” meaning “same gaze,” is descriptive. The song is about getting lost in the eyes, falling deep into each other\'s gaze like diving into the ocean. It’s a gaze that heats up the room. “The Rainy Night” is a bit more of a bitter emotional piano ballad. It’s quite different from the previous tracks, giving it a unique charm. <br><br>&nbsp;From here we are getting back to being motivated. “Far” is about reaching beyond our goals without anything or anyone stopping us. It’s not overflowing but still energizing, and the beat will make you bounce with the music. The seventh song brings typical <strong>Hitchhiker</strong> and Neo vibes to the tracklist. It’s a powerful hybrid between trap and hip-hop, and to me, “Bring The Noize” is about speeding through the negative noises that surround us in life. It\'s pretty empowering, and makes me believe I’ve “got no limits.” Jaehyun’s rap in the third verse is one of my favorite parts from the entire album. We’ve already gotten a little taste of its performance version, and I’m hoping “Bring The Noize” will have more stage opportunities.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> “Magic Carpet Ride” feels like it\'s taking us on a trip to the starry skies of dreamland, already feeling very soft and enchanting through its track video. “Road Trip” just straight up makes me miss the times we could freely travel and go on adventures pre-pandemic. It’s a refreshing, cute track with acoustic guitar and a calming melody. This song is perfect for those upcoming rainy days, like the one shown in the track video. &nbsp;<br><br><br>For closing, we get two more sweet tracks. In the colorful track video filled with beautiful flowers, “Dreamer” felt like a dream scene from a romance movie. It has a playful, youthful, and bright sound that will make you groove along. If you start your day with this track (only after “Breakfast” of course), it might color your reality dreamier too.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The last track is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZkqi_Hja0">“Promise You,”</a> a mid-tempo synth-pop love letter to the fans that once again made me realize that this group is filled with the sweetest voices. The original Korean title “다시 만나는 날” translates to “The Day We Meet Again” in English, and the two titles combined tell exactly what the song is about—NCT 127’s promise to meet the fans again. A perfect closing to the long awaited comeback.<br><br><br><br></div><div>source: <a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/9/19/nct-127-and-the-sticker-comeback-dont-judge-a-book-album-by-its-cover-title-song">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/9/19/nct-127-and-the-sticker-comeback-dont-judge-a-book-album-by-its-cover-title-song</a></div><div><br></div>',

LISA also served as a dance mentor on <strong>iQIYI</strong>’s <em>Youth With You Season 2</em> and <em>Youth With You Season 3</em>, a Chinese survival program that created a Chinese girl and boy group.&nbsp; <br><br> LISA’s debut single album features four tracks including title track “LALISA,\'\' English B-Side track “MONEY,” and instrumental versions of both songs. “LALISA” was composed by producers <strong>24</strong>, <strong>Bekuh BOOM</strong>, and <strong>Teddy</strong>—with lyrics written by Teddy and BOOM—whereas “MONEY” had composing assistance from additional producers, <strong>Vince </strong>and <strong>R.Tee</strong>.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br> In “LALISA,” the hip-hop and bold brass riff create a powerful ambiance to a track that refers to LISA’s birth name. With a strong rhythm, this song allows fans to connect her name to words like energetic, confident, daring, and bad-ass. LISA shows her versatility with her vocals and rap, using a mix of Korean and English lyrics. With lyrics like, “Remember my name that’s standing right in front of you,” she wants the whole world to remember her for who she is and to never forget it. There is even a moment of praise and respect towards her hard work in the music industry in the lyrics, “From Thailand to Korea, and now here, went for the throat, being the greatest of all time ain’t fantasy,” and, “Jet black and pink crown belongs to we (BLACKPINK).” For her solo debut, LISA has certainly brought a gold standard to her name.&nbsp; <br><br><br> This debut music video feels insanely expensive based on the production, outfits, and stages alone—feeling very much like a true <strong>YG Entertainment</strong>-produced video. In the video, LISA is dressed in various outfits that’ll make it difficult to pick a favorite; however, the one that truly stands out from the rest is the <strong>ASAVA </strong>gold silk cape crop top and mini-skirt. The designer and founder of the fashion brand, <strong>‘Moo’ Polpat Asavaprapha</strong>, is the creative mastermind behind this custom-made two-piece gown, an outfit made with Thai brocade golden silk and traditional patterns that showcases a signature take on Thai traditional clothing. The outfit is paired with a Great Victory crown to create a beautiful outfit that allows LISA to pay homage and love to her roots. In addition to the two-piece, LISA is seen wearing an outfit from the Mexican brand <strong>NoName</strong>’s REDO collection, an outfit by Chilean designer <strong>SEVALI</strong>, and a satin corset top from <strong>Vivienne Westwood</strong>. Aside from the fashion, the music video showcases LISA’s confidence and bad-ass aura with cutthroat choreography. There’s even a moment in the video where she’s added pole dancing to an already difficult choreography. <br><br><br><br> There were tons of small details that fans might’ve missed—LISA riding a bike into a tunnel as a nod to BLACKPINK’s debut music video “BOOMBAYAH,” her birth name “LALISA” featured in the background, and a small choreography detail that resembles LISA’s name with hand symbols as a hand-shaped L with an A. LISA’s music video is said to have hit the 10 million mark on YouTube in just 90 minutes, already breaking a record in under two hours! <br><br><br> There’s never been any doubt on the versatility and talent that LISA exudes, and her solo release only proves that she’s capable of being successful outside of BLACKPINK. She’s brought honorable praise to her country, her name, and who she is overall with confidence in her solo debut. BLINKS, make sure to stream <em>LALISA </em>on Spotify or YouTube Music, and stay up-to-date with her on Instagram!

                'content' => '<div>&nbsp;June 4, 2021 <br><br>&nbsp;On November 27, 2019, <strong>EXO</strong> released their sixth full-length album <em>OBSESSION</em> and the music video for title track “Obsession.” This was the group’s first release after members <strong>D.O</strong> and <strong>Xiumin</strong> enlisted, and saw the group battling evil clones of themselves known as <strong>X-EXO</strong>. While title track “Obsession” is described as a hip-hop dance track, the other tracks boast genres like dance pop, hip-hop, funk, trap, and reggae. The final track on <em>OBSESSION</em> is the Chinese version of the title track; unlike previous releases, it does not feature <strong>LAY</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Music Video</h1><div><br><br>The music video for “Obsession” opens with the group as their X-EXO personas before alternating between EXO and X-EXO. While the lyrics are directed towards ex-lovers, ex-friends, the media, and <em>sasaeng</em> fans that won’t go away due to their obsession with the group, at first glance, the music video seems to be nothing more than a war between EXO and X-EXO. However, if you look more closely within the video, you’ll find that X-EXO embodies many of the negative traits that EXO are trying to escape.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Chen</strong>’s X-EXO version is monitoring everybody and everything throughout the music video, much like how <em>sasaeng</em>s follow their idols much too closely. Both personas of <strong>Suho</strong> are seen working their way through a museum, but at one point his EXO side is seen floating in the air as if he is a piece of art to be displayed for people to enjoy and nothing more. Another scene where this message is conveyed more directly is when <strong>Sehun</strong> points an arrow towards his X-EXO version, who is seated in a chair covered with arrows in front of a bullseye. This scene can be taken quite literally as EXO “taking their shot” at the people who feel they’re owed something by the group.<br><br></div><div><br>We’re also treated to two physical battles within the music video, one where the two versions of <strong>Baekhyun</strong> fence, and the other where <strong>Chanyeol</strong> battles his X-EXO version utilizing his fire power that has been associated with him since the early days of EXO. Another battle comes in the form of Chen playing a game of chess against X-EXO Chen. While slightly less clear, <strong>Kai</strong>’s EXO and X-EXO versions seem to be playing a game of cat and mouse, with his X-EXO side carrying a <em>muleta</em>, or Matador’s cape, to anger and push his EXO side.<br><br><br></div><h1><a href="https://youtu.be/uxmP4b2a0uY">EXO 엑소 \'Obsession\' MV</a></h1><div><br><br><br></div><h1>The Comeback Performances</h1><div>&nbsp;<br><br>EXO had their comeback for “Obsession” during their <strong>V LIVE</strong> concert, <em>EXO THE STAGE</em>, on November 29, 2019, where they revealed the EXO and X-EXO stages of “Obsession.” It was announced on the official X-EXO and EXO Twitter accounts that whichever of the two stages received the higher view counts, that group’s close-up cams would be released first. After the end of the viewing period, which ran from 8 p.m. KST on November 30 to 11:59 p.m. KST on December 1, EXO-Ls were treated to the close-up cams of X-EXO. While X-EXO gained the most views during that time period, the EXO performance now has over 1.5 million views more.<br><br></div><div><br>For the performances of “Obsession,” EXO and X-EXO wore outfits seen from the music video and performed on the same stage design, but with different lighting and images on the screens behind them. While the EXO stage featured standard lighting on the group for the most part with flashes of green and an image of a castle behind them, the X-EXO stage had the group lit in red with flashes of orange and an image of the castle in ruins. &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There were also some differences in the choreography, most notably during Kai’s “Take whatever” part: in the EXO version of the stage, Kai is seen turning to his left and reaching out with his left hand to snatch at something, but in the X-EXO version, these actions are performed to his right. For a cool comparison of the two stages where the performances alternate, check out the official EXO and X-EXO upload.<br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Legacy</h1><div><br><br>EXO took home five music show wins during “Obsession” promotions: two from <em>Music Bank</em> on December 6 and December 13, two from <em>Show! Music Core</em> on December 7 and December 14, and one from <em>Show Champion</em> on December 11. Less than a year after its release, on August 12, 2020, the music video for “Obsession” surpassed 100 million views on YouTube, becoming the eleventh EXO track to accomplish this feat.<br><br></div><div><em><br>OBSESSION</em> peaked and debuted at No. 1 on the <strong>Gaon Weekly Album Chart</strong>. The album also peaked at No. 1 on the <strong>Gaon Weekly Album Chart</strong> for November and December, and was their fifth release to peak at No. 1 on the <strong>Billboard World Albums Chart</strong>.<br><br></div><div><br>A majority of the tracks on <em>OBSESSION</em> charted on more than one <strong>Gaon</strong> and <strong>Billboard</strong> chart, with “Obsession,” “Trouble,” and “Jekyll” appearing more commonly on the charts than the other tracks. On the <strong>Gaon Weekly Digital Chart</strong>, “Obsession” peaked and debuted at No. 13, “Trouble” peaked at No. 85, “Groove” peaked at No. 93, “Jekyll” peaked at No. 96, and “Butterfly Effect” peaked at No. 98. For the <strong>Gaon Weekly Streaming Chart</strong>, “Obsession” debuted at No. 55 but peaked at No. 28, “Trouble” peaked at No. 79, “Groove” peaked at No. 88, “Butterfly Effect” peaked at No. 90, and “Jekyll” peaked at No. 94.<br><br></div><div><br>All ten tracks off of <em>OBSESSION</em> appeared on the <strong>Gaon Weekly Download Chart</strong>: “Obsession” debuted at No. 1, “Trouble” at No. 11, “Butterfly Effect” at No. 12, “Groove” at No. 13, “Day After Day” at No. 15, “Jekyll” at No. 16, “Non Stop” at No. 17, “Baby You Are” at No. 18, “Ya Ya Ya” at No. 19, and “Obsession - Chinese Version” at No. 33. The following week, all but “Obsession” had dropped off the chart, with the title track lingering there for the rest of 2019 and the first two weeks of 2020.<br><br></div><div><br>“Obsession,” “Trouble,” and “Jekyll” also appeared on the <strong>Billboard U.S. World Digital Song Sales Chart</strong>, peaking at No. 1, No. 19, and No. 22 respectively. “Obsession” is EXO’s fourth track to hit No. 1 on the chart. Nine of the <em>OBSESSION</em> tracks also charted on the <strong>Billboard K-Pop 100</strong>, with “Obsession” peaking at No. 5, “Trouble” peaking at No. 37, “Groove” peaking at No. 43, “Butterfly Effect” peaking at No. 44, “Jekyll” peaking at No. 46, “Ya Ya Ya” peaking at No. 49, “Baby You Are” peaking at No. 50,&nbsp; “Day After Day” peaking at No. 51, and “Non Stop” peaking at No. 52.<br><br></div><div><br>During the year-end awards season, EXO was nominated for many awards, with the group winning “Best Group” at the <em>Asian Pop Music Awards</em>, “K-Pop Male Group” at the <em>BreakTudo Awards</em>, “Top 10 Artists” at the <em>MelOn Music Awards</em>, “Hallyu Special Award” and “Bonsang Award” at the <em>Seoul Music Awards</em>, “Album of the Year - 4th Quarter” for <em>OBSESSION</em> and “Top Kit Seller of the Year” for the <em>OBSESSION</em> kit at the 2020 <em>Gaon Chart Music Awards</em>, and “Disc Bonsang” for <em>OBSESSION</em> and “QQ Music Fans Choice K-Pop Artist” at the 2020 <em>Golden Disc Awards.<br></em><br></div><div><br>EXO were also nominated for awards at three separate American music awards that they unfortunately did not win: “Favorite Social Artist” at the <em>American Music Awards</em>, “Top Social Artist” at the <em>Billboard Music Awards</em>, and “Best K-Pop Video” for “Obsession” at the 2020 <em>MTV Video Music Awards</em>.<br><br></div><div><br>It has been over 550 days since EXO has released a new album as a group. Between the release of <em>OBSESSION</em> and the upcoming release of <em>DON’T FIGHT THE FEELING</em> on June 7, 2021, this is the longest gap in EXO’s career between album releases. But thankfully, EXO-Ls have not been without new music from their favorite boys, as <strong>SM Entertainment</strong> turned their focus toward EXO solo releases. In 2020, leader Suho released his debut mini-album <em>Self-Portrait</em> before enlisting, Baekhyun released his second solo mini-album <em>Delight</em> and digital song “Amusement Park,” sub-unit <strong>EXO-SC</strong> released their first full-length album <em>1 Billion Views</em>, LAY released his fourth album <em>LIT </em>and featured on track “Love You More” with <strong>Steve Aoki</strong> and <strong>will.i.am</strong>, Chen released his digital single “Hello” before enlisting, and fans finally got the debut of solo artist <strong>KAI</strong>. <strong>SuperM</strong>, the SM Entertainment boy group featuring Kai and Baekhyun, also released their first full-length album <em>Super One</em> in 2020.<br><br></div><div><br>So far, this year has brought us a third Baekhyun mini-album, <em>Bambi</em>, and the exciting news about <em>DON’T FIGHT THE FEELING</em>, but it’s just a matter of time before we’ll see what the remaining EXO members have in store for us in 2021.<br><br></div><div><br>&nbsp;</div><div>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/6/4/exo-and-the-obsession-comeback">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/6/4/exo-and-the-obsession-comeback</a><br><br></div>',

                'content' => '<div>March 5, 2021 <br><br>&nbsp;On December 13, 2018, <strong>EXO</strong> released <em>LOVE SHOT</em>, the repackage of their fifth album <em>DON’T MESS UP MY TEMPO</em>, along with a music video for the title track, “Love Shot.” The repackaged album includes four new tracks along with the original 11: the Korean and Chinese versions of “Love Shot,” “Trauma,” and “Wait.” Members <strong>Chen</strong> and <strong>Chanyeol</strong> have writing credits for “Love Shot,” helping to give the song its haunting yet sensual vibe. While <strong>LAY </strong>was featured in the Chinese version of “Tempo,” he does not feature in the Chinese version of “Love Shot.” This was also the last comeback to feature members <strong>D.O</strong> and <strong>Xiumin</strong> before they enlisted.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1>The Music Videos</h1><div><br>Even though the lyrics for “Love Shot” are about a relationship that’s gone sour and wanting to rekindle it and find the love that’s gone missing, the music video doesn’t seem to really portray that plot. Rather, the choreography-heavy video shows the members confronting masked men as the major plot point. While the masked men are holding realistic looking guns, EXO are seen holding clear guns filled with various liquors—like they can only face these problems with a little bit of liquid courage. It could be argued that the men are meant to represent all of the things that could go wrong in a relationship, all of the different arguments and disagreements a couple could face, but for the most part the “Love Shot” music video is EXO showing off their incredible dancing abilities and we’re not complaining.<br><br><br></div><h1><a href="https://youtu.be/pSudEWBAYRE">EXO 엑소 \'Love Shot\' MV</a></h1><div><br><br><br></div><h1>The Comeback Performance</h1><div><br>EXO had their comeback for “Love Shot” on the December 14, 2018 episode of <em>Music Bank</em>. They only promoted “Love Shot” here, though in later appearances they would also go on to perform “Tempo.” The group wore their different colored suits seen in the music video, with the stage set to resemble the theater from the video.<br><br><br></div><h1>The Legacy</h1><div><br>“Love Shot” peaked in the top ten of multiple charts, including peaking at No. 9 on the <strong>Gaon Weekly Digital Songs Chart</strong>, No. 1 on the <strong>Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 Chart</strong>, and No. 1 on the <strong>Billboard U.S. World Digital Songs Chart</strong>. <em>LOVE SHOT</em> peaked at No. 1 on the <strong>Gaon Weekly Albums Chart</strong> and No. 8 on the <strong>Billboard U.S. World Albums Chart</strong>.<br><br></div><div><br>During promotions, “Love Shot” took home three music show wins: one on <em>Show! Music Core</em> on December 22 and two on <em>Music Bank</em> on December 21 and December 28. This is the same amount of wins that previous title track “Tempo” took home as well, though one of the wins for “Tempo” took place at the beginning of 2019 on <em>Music Bank</em> where it beat, get this, “Love Shot.”<br><br></div><div><br>The music video for “Love Shot” is their most popular to date, sitting with just over 381 million views on YouTube, and was EXO’s fastest music video to reach 350 million. Their next most popular music videos are “Monster” with 369 million views and “Ko Ko Bop” at 300 million. “CALL ME BABY,” their track with the most music show wins to date, has almost 100 million less views than “Love Shot.”<br><br></div><div><br>While nothing can truly compare to the power of EXO performing “Love Shot,” the track is one of their most covered by other idol groups, including <strong>EVERGLOW</strong>, <strong>Dreamcatcher</strong>, <strong>IZ*ONE</strong>, and <strong>Hwanwoong</strong> from <strong>ONEUS</strong>. Members of <strong>The Boyz</strong>, <strong>ASTRO</strong>, <strong>CIX</strong>, and <strong>SF9</strong> came together for an idol dance cover challenge for <strong>SBS</strong> and SF9 also performed a cover of “Love Shot” at <em>KCON 2019 NY</em>, where EXO-L <strong>Yoo Taeyang</strong> got to shine dressed like his favorite member, <strong>Kai</strong>. <strong>San</strong> from <strong>ATEEZ</strong> is also known to be a massive EXO-L and Kai fan, and will frequently dance to “Love Shot” during VLIVE appearances and on variety shows, though other ATEEZ members have also danced to the track.<br><br><br> But with all of that taken into consideration, it’s surprising that “Love Shot” and the repackaged album didn’t receive any awards during the year-end awards season. The track was nominated for “Best Song” and “Best Male Dance Track” at the 2019 <em>Melon Music Awards</em>, “Digital Bonsang” at the 2020 <em>Golden Disc Awards</em>, and “Song of the Year - December” at the 2020 <em>Gaon Chart Music Awards</em> while <em>LOVE SHOT</em> was nominated for “Album of the Year - 4th Quarter” at the 2020 <em>Gaon Chart Music Awards </em>and “Best Album” at <em>Melon Music Awards</em>. In a fun twist of fate, however, the album that took home “Album of the Year - 4th Quarter” was <em>DON’T MESS UP MY TEMPO</em>. &nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/5/exo-and-the-love-shot-comeback">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/5/exo-and-the-love-shot-comeback</a><br><br></div>',

            'content' => '<div>&nbsp;June 14, 2021 <br><strong><br>BTS</strong> is celebrating eight years since their debut this year, so to celebrate this momentous occasion, let’s take a look at some of their best B-side tracks over the years. With a massive discography like that of BTS, there are many B-side songs that deserve the spotlight, but we chose the following six underrated B-sides.<br><br><br></div><h1>“전하지 못한 진심 (The Truth Untold)” ft. Steve Aoki</h1><div><br>“The Truth Untold” is a soaring rock ballad that was a completely unexpected track on 2018’s <em>LOVE YOURSELF 轉 Tear</em>. Being a collaboration with EDM producer <strong>Steve Aoki</strong>, fans expected the song to be a dance-pop banger. However, the track was an emotional ballad with one of the group’s best vocal deliveries. Performed by <strong>Jin</strong>, <strong>Jimin</strong>, <strong>V</strong>, and <strong>Jungkook</strong>, the track makes references to&nbsp; “La Città di Smeraldo,” an Italian tale about a man who hides in his house because he’s afraid of showing himself.<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><h1>“Tomorrow”</h1><div><br>A perfect body-roll song, “Tomorrow” actually talks about the serious responsibilities that come with turning 20 years old. From the group’s 2014 album <em>Skool Luv Affair</em>, the song was co-written by the rap line, <strong>SUGA</strong>, <strong>RM</strong>, and <strong>j-hope</strong>. The demo for the song was written before their debut by member SUGA, and contains a static piano and electric guitar melody increasing the track’s excitement.<br><br><br></div><h1>“Stay”</h1><div><br>Reigning from their latest album <em>BE</em>, “Stay” is a subunit track performed by members RM, Jin, and Jungkook with the <em>maknae</em> also leading the songwriting process of the song. On the mellow album, “Stay” is an explosion of positive energy, but still contains emotional lyrics about staying together through all that life throws at you.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><h1>“21st Century Girl”</h1><div><em><br>WINGS </em>is often regarded as a turning point in BTS’s career. With a new direction in sound, the album contained a more mature vibe, however “21st Century Girl” was a perfect throwback. Reminiscent of their early years, the song features their powerful and hard-hitting rap and vocal delivery, all while containing a beautiful message of love.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1>“욱 (UGH!)”</h1><div><br>A perfect song for when the world gets on your nerves, “욱 (UGH!)” is a powerful hip-hop song on the group’s quadruple selling album, <em>MAP OF THE SOUL: 7</em>. A lyrical masterpiece, the Korean title comes from the verb “욱하다,” which means “to say words driven by a sudden, strong anger.” Phonetically, it also sounds like “Ugh.”<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><h1>“Butterfly”</h1><div><br>Co-written by SUGA, j-hope, and RM, “Butterfly” expresses the fear of losing someone through the metaphor of a butterfly, representing the ephemerality of time. A beautiful message, the track appeared on their fourth mini-album <em>화양연화 (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life)</em>, and was later included in 2016’s compilation album<em> 화양연화 Young Forever (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever)</em>.<br><br><br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/6/14/bts-b-sides">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/6/14/bts-b-sides</a></div>',

Framed as the online edition of the concerts the group had to postpone due to COVID-19, <em>ON:E</em> drew in as many as 1 million concurrent viewers and served up a plethora of intricate stages that created a mind-blowing concert experience, despite fans being stuck at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>An Experience Like No Other</h1><div><br>It was clear from the start that <em>MAP OF THE SOUL ON:E</em> would be a high-production event. Prior to the two-day concert, <strong>BigHit Entertainment</strong> announced that production costs for <em>ON:E</em> were eight times that of <em>BANG BANG CON</em>, with four different stages and the integration of AR and XR technologies. The label also put out a call for fans to participate in “ARMY on Air.” Using the lottery system similar to offline event ticketing, fans could apply for one of the two shows to appear live in front of BTS on digital screens, giving the allusion of an in-person audience for the group members and allowing fans to have a more interactive concert experience.<br><br></div><div><br>BigHit offered several viewing packages for the concerts, including tickets for both shows with multi-cam views, single view tickets with 4K resolution, and concert tickets paired with exhibition tickets (another online event that will open on October 13). Fans could also preorder concert merch via Weverse before the shows and will soon be able to buy additional commemorative merch such as physical tickets and an acrylic poster. Much like BTS’s previous tour, fans will also have the opportunity to buy merch at the upcoming online and offline pop-up stores, accessible for many global fans despite the pandemic.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>Traversing through Seven Years of History</h1><div><br>The setlist for <em>MAP OF THE SOUL ON:E</em> varied just slightly for each concert, with similar small variations in costuming. It’s clear from the programming that <em>ON:E</em>, like the<em> MAP OF THE SOUL</em> album series, was a look back at BTS’s past merged with their present.<br><br></div><div><br>After an opening VCR with visual references to the “ON” music video, the concert opened with a marching band, complete with a flag guard. An absolutely powerful performance of “ON,” “N.O,” and “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2” followed, where BTS wowed fans with dance breaks that referenced older performances and awesome new mixes of these classic tracks.<br><br></div><div><br>RM’s “Persona” was the first of the solo tracks and featured the same AR giant RM seen in the track’s music video. In-line with this throwback-inspired track, the stage then shifted to “상남자 (Boy in Luv),” before moving on to the first talk segment. Next was a stripped down (but still trap) version of “Dionysus,” with another VCR leading into Suga’s “Interlude: Shadow” and “Black Swan,” with a mesmerizing solo dance by Jimin to the orchestral version of the song.<br><br></div><div><br>The next VCR brought us to the unit tracks, with the aggressiveness of the rap line’s “UGH!” paired with a boxing ring stage and the vocal line’s “00:00 Zero O’clock” staged with classic mic stands and a simple digital clock. The next VCR break took fans into the vocal line’s solo songs, with sultry performances from Jungkook (“My Time”) and Jimin (“Filter”), a <em>Le Petit Prince</em>-themed stage for Jin’s “Moon” (with an actual giant moon and fox masks for the backup dancers), and a magical carousel stage for V’s “Inner Child,” where he sang to a young boy, representative of his younger self. “Inner Child” also created an opportunity for more interactivity with the audience, where fans were asked to sing along with the ending, which was then blended with V’s vocals.<br><br></div><div><br>After another VCR, j-hope’s playful “Outro: Ego” wrapped up the solo stages and led into a remix of “Boy with Luv,” which was similar to the colorful <em>BANG BANG CON</em> performance with umbrellas. BTS ended the concert with “DNA,” “Dope,” and “No More Dream,” again referencing their past but this time with an awesome AR-infused stage that projected them across a variety of digital environments.<br><br></div><div><br>The encore varied between the two concerts, with Day 1 featuring “Butterfly,” “Run,” and “Dynamite,” and Day 2 with “Spring Day,” “IDOL,” and “Dynamite.” Both concert encores ended with an emotional “We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal.” For the four-song encore, the members stood in front of digital screens with projections of real fans watching the concert (winners of the “ARMY on Air” lottery). The inclusion of fans into the performance gave the members a chance to walk around looking at their audience while also letting a few lucky fans take part in the creation of the concert.<br><br></div><h1>Until We Meet Again</h1><div><br>It wasn’t hard to see how much these performances meant to both BTS and ARMY, with the heartfelt talks by the members and the outpouring of love on social media from fans. “We are literally strong. The ARMYs I know, and the BTS you all know, are all strong,” RM said in his closing talk. “We’ll find a way. We always have. If there’s no way, let’s draw the map again. So, no worries, we’re strong, and we’re still connected.”<br><br></div><div><br>Despite being a virtual concert, <em>MAP OF THE SOUL ON:E</em> was everything an offline BTS concert always is: high quality, enthralling, and fulfilling. Though the current state of the world has made it difficult for artists to connect with fans, BTS found a way to fill that void to the best of their ability with their impactful performances, sincere words, and their team’s creativity. So until fans and BTS can meet again in offline spaces, ARMY has a small but certain happiness to hang on to.<br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/10/13/bts-connects-with-army-through-innovative-online-concert">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/10/13/bts-connects-with-army-through-innovative-online-concert</a><br><br></div>',

Her style has become a great inspiration and has helped create many trends. Her style is an effortless, chic look that ranges from classic business wear, to preppy, to ‘90s streetwear, which has made her distinct both on and off stage.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>Cardigans are Key</h1><div><br>Varying in pattern, color, and size, button-up cardigans are a must-have in Jennie’s closet. Not only can they be used for a comfy, casual look, Jennie will just wear a cardigan as a shirt for a simple, preppy look.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>Crop Tops</h1><div><br>For a casual look, Jennie’s daily go-to will be a cropped tee, cropped polo, or a cropped fitted tee. She will typically pair them with a straight leg jean, or a wide leg pant for a quick but cute look.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><h1>Preppy</h1><div><br>Jennie loves the preppy look, and particularly the preppy look from the ‘90s, with fashion inspiration from movies such as <em>Clueless</em>. Polo shirts and blazers with a matching bottom are a frequent style seen on Jennie and she will pair them with a variety of accessories, including a chunky headband, scrunchies, sunglasses, or a necklace.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><h1>Patterns</h1><div><br>For her tops, or even as a matching set, Jennie loves to use patterns in her style, particularly gingham, stripes, and floral prints. She will often layer them over a simple outfit or over patterns to finish her look.<br><br><br><br></div><h1>Bonus: Jennie’s love of Chanel</h1><div><br>A brand that really encompasses Jennie’s style, and she\'s not afraid to show her love of the brand, is <strong>Chanel</strong>. Their tweed blazers are a big part of her preppy style, but she will wear their more simple tees and hats for a dressed down, casual look.</div><div><br><br><br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/3/idol-fashion-jennie">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/3/3/idol-fashion-jennie</a><br><br></div>',

            'content' => '<div>&nbsp;June 28, 2020 <br><br>Arguably the biggest group in K-Pop today, <strong>BLACKPINK</strong> has already solidified their impact in K-Pop history. Though the group only debuted in 2016, they’ve already shattered numerous records held by other artists across the globe. In celebration for the girl group finally getting a comeback after a full year, we are diving into the group’s successes in just four short years.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Formed by <strong>YG Entertainment</strong> in 2016, BLACKPINK marked the first girl group to debut under the company in six years, with the last being <strong>2NE1</strong>. Three of the four members have foreign backgrounds—<strong>Jennie</strong> was born in Korea but spent much of her life in New Zealand, <strong>Rosé</strong> was born in New Zealand but grew up in Australia, and <strong>Lisa</strong> is a native of Thailand, making <strong>Jisoo</strong> the sole member born and raised in Korea. Jennie was a fairly well-known trainee, having participated in filming music videos for <strong>G-DRAGON</strong> and <strong>LEE HI</strong>, and was the first member publicly released followed by Lisa, Jisoo, and Rosé.<br><br></div><div><br>August 26 marked the debut single album <em>SQUARE ONE</em>, with both tracks “Boombayah” and “Whistle” getting the title treatment. They were immediately well-received, with both tracks shooting up to the first and second place on the <strong>Billboard World Digital Songs</strong> Chart, making them the fastest group to accomplish this and join labelmates <strong>PSY</strong> and <strong>BIGBANG</strong> at the top. 13 days after debut, they grabbed their first music show win on <em>Inkigayo</em>, breaking the record for the shortest time for a girl group to win on a music program.<br><br><br>Single album <em>SQUARE TWO</em>, the group’s first comeback, came swiftly in November of 2016, with another double title comeback in “Playing With Fire” and “Stay.” Despite only having four tracks to their name, the girls won a myriad of major awards during 2016’s awards season, including big names like the <em>Asia Artist Awards</em>, <em>Melon Music Awards</em>, and <em>Golden Disk Awards</em>.<br><br></div><div><br>2017 only saw the quartet releasing single “As If It’s Your Last,” a song that took a different turn from previous releases with a heavier EDM influence and a different approach to the group’s capitalized girl crush concept. While BLACKPINK enjoyed massive success in Korea and general recognition worldwide, the true complete breakthrough came in 2018 with the release of their first mini-album <em>SQUARE UP</em> and title track “DDU-DU DDU-DU.” As it currently stands, the title track music video holds 1.1 billion views on YouTube, surpassing the massively popular “Gangnam Style” from 2012 and becoming the most viewed K-Pop video on the Internet.<br><br><br><strong>“DDU-DU DDU-DU”</strong> is proof YG producer <strong>Teddy</strong>’s staying power coupled with the growing girl crush movement as the track made it onto such worldly charts&nbsp; that other K-Pop songs had yet to travel. This release brought on worldwide massive success to the girls and lead to their first world tour at the end of 2018, despite only having nine songs on their discography. The quartet also became one of the first highly recognized K-Pop acts to begin collaborating with Western artists (alongside <strong>BTS </strong>and other major K-Pop artists)—<strong>Dua Lipa</strong> being the first singer to release a collaboration with BLACKPINK in 2018.<br><br></div><div><br>YG Entertainment stated in 2018 that they intend to have each member of BLACKPINK have a solo debut, the announcement shortly followed by a schedule for Jennie’s solo release. Late 2018 saw her first single “SOLO,” with reception and success on par with her groups’ full releases. Two full years later, YG finally announced the intent to have the other girls release their solo work <strong>after</strong> the full album release in September 2020.<br><br> Blinks would have to wait another ten months to hear something new from the group, which came in the form of title track <strong>“Kill This Love”</strong> and mini-album of the same name in the first half of 2019. Shortly after the release, the girls became the first K-Pop girl group to perform at the massive Western music festival <em>Coachella</em>. Over a year later, a new comeback was finally announced after months of being pushed back, along with a new collaboration with pop sensation <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The most common complaint many have about BLACKPINK is something that isn’t necessarily their fault, but lies more with their company management. Despite coming up on their fourth year in the industry, the girls only have two mini-albums and three single albums to their name, while groups from the same debut time have released far more music. It’s not uncommon to hear the girls of BLACKPINK be described as Instagram models with a side music career rather than idols, as they are more often seen at social events than actually in the studio preparing new music. Fans of YG groups are likely not unfamiliar with this cycle, though it seems that BLACKPINK gets the short end of the stick more than their other artists, particularly boy groups.<br><br></div><div><br>However, the future looks bright for the group in 2020, as they are finally slated to release their first full length album in the fall. Pre-release track “How You Like That” is finally out, and the hype for their return is palpable!<br><br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/6/28/history-of-k-pop-blackpink">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/6/28/history-of-k-pop-blackpink</a><br><br></div>',

With members enlisting and solo projects being released, EXO’s <em>DON’T FIGHT THE FEELING </em>is the group’s first release since 2019’s <em>OBSESSION</em>. Inevitably, fans were extremely excited upon the announcement of the comeback back in April when the group also celebrated their ninth debut anniversary. The excitement rose even higher when it was announced that member <strong>LAY</strong> would be part of the album, his first since 2018’s cameo in the “Tempo” music video. Let’s dive into EXO’s special album and take a look at what they have to offer.<br><br></div><h1>Let’s Talk Music</h1><div><br>Tracklist:</div><ol><li>&nbsp;Don’t fight the feeling&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;파라다이스 (Paradise)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;훅! (No matter)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Runaway (도망자)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;지켜줄게 (Just as usual)&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br><strong><br>“Don’t fight the feeling”<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Thematically a sequel to “Obsession” and sonically a sequel to “Power,” the title track for the album combines the best of both worlds. “Don’t fight the feeling” is a dance-pop anthem with light synthesizer, heavy bass, and lyrics referring to feeling free of constraints and living life on your own terms. The track was produced by the team behind rookie group <strong>P1Harmony</strong>’s new album <em>DISHARMONY : BREAKOUT</em>, with lyrics by <strong>SM Entertainment</strong>’s resident hitmaker, <strong>Kenzie</strong>. A very easy listen, the track is an instant earworm. Despite its simple pop production, the members\' delivery amplifies the track’s dynamic, making it a giant dance party.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The track’s music video sees the members heading out into space, thematically referring to the earth that was destroyed in the final scene of the “Obsession” music video. Member LAY was part of the music video as well, with his scenes superimposed with shots of the rest of the group. The track also ties into SM Entertainment’s “SMCU,” with visuals and lyrics once again referring to the “KWANGYA.” “Don’t fight the feeling” therefore joins the growing line of songs that have mentioned this new concept of wilderness. Watch the colorful music video for “Don’t fight the feeling” below!<br><br></div><h1><a href="https://youtu.be/2IkoKhr6Tss">EXO 엑소 \'Don\'t fight the feeling\' MV</a></h1><div><br><br></div><h1>B-Sides</h1><div><br>The album’s B-sides open with the funky love song “파라다이스 (Paradise).” The track was co-written and produced by <strong>Brandon Arreaga</strong> and <strong>Edwin Honoret </strong>of the R&amp;B boy group <strong>PRETTYMUCH</strong>. The song is an uptempo R&amp;B-pop track where the members express their feelings of falling in love, comparing it to the feeling of entering heaven through witty lyrics. Track three, “훅! (No matter),” is another funky retro track reminiscent of 2000s swing-R&amp;B songs. An assuring song, with this track EXO provides comfort to their listeners that they will always be with them no matter what happens.<br><br></div><div><br>“훅! (No matter)” is followed by quite possibly the best track on the album, “Runaway (도망자).” The song is a magnificent R&amp;B track with heavy bass and drums and EXO’s signature vocal harmonies. The song’s message is similar to “Don’t fight the feeling” as the boys wish to simply run away, free from the troubles of life. The song was co-written by American producer and viral sensation <strong>Bazzi</strong>, who previously worked with the group on their own viral sensation “The Eve” for their studio album <em>The War</em>.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The album closes with the acoustic pop track, “지켜줄게 (Just as usual)” co-written by <strong>Amoeba Culture</strong>’s songwriter <strong>THAMA</strong>. The song is an emotional guitar-assisted track with the Korean title translating to “Will protect you.” EXO closes the album with a warm embrace, reassuring their fans that they will survive the hardships together. EXO plays on their strengths with strong R&amp;B songs, a signature of the group ever since their debut nine years ago. Every track has beautiful harmonies, vocal moments, and rap delivery.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>With the new special album, EXO reassures fans and K-Pop listeners in general that they are going nowhere anytime soon. With the ongoing enlistment of the members, the group’s numbers might be lower but their power remains high. EXO not only gifted their fans five incredible songs, but also cherished moments like member LAY harmonizing with the rest of the group on all tracks of the album, members <strong>Chanyeol</strong> and <strong>Sehun</strong> rapping back and forth, and members <strong>Baekhyun</strong>, <strong>Xiumin</strong>, and <strong>D.O</strong>’s incredible vocal runs marking the latter two’s return from the military. We also got a rare Sehun, LAY, and <strong>Kai</strong> choreography moment in the music video. The special album is definitely special in many ways. EXO reorients themselves, trying out new styles and sounds, all the while making catchy dance-pop music.

But can the album live up to the huge expectations? Short answer: Definitely. The long answer continues down below.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Tracklist:</div><ol><li>&nbsp;맛 (Hot Sauce)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Diggity&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;고래 (Dive Into You)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;우리의 계절 (My Youth)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Rocket&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Countdown (3, 2, 1)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;ANL&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;주인공 (Irreplaceable)&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;지금처럼만 (Be There For You) by Renjun, Haechan, Chenle&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Rainbow (책갈피)&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br><br></div><h1>The Album: <em>맛 (Hot Sauce)</em></h1><div><br>One single album, four mini-albums, and almost five years after their debut, NCT Dream’s first full-length studio album is hitting a lot harder than imagined. <em>맛 (Hot Sauce)</em> plays with several different genres and concepts, from hip-hop and R&amp;B to ballads, and what unites it all is the storyline of their friendship.<br><br></div><div><br>Through the 10 brand new tracks of the album, we get to see the seven different individuals—or seven different flavors of hot sauce if you’d like—come together as one, uniting in NCT Dream’s very unique style. Following their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRw1XRNQE8&amp;list=PLWznbX9Vr47heoMr_s9IsTwoYmMaXxSoH&amp;ab_channel=NCTDREAM"><em>7llin\' in the DREAM</em></a> variety show, we now aren’t limited to seeing, but clearly get to hear how unified and close the members are with songs dedicated completely to their bond. This sounds (and actually is) deep, but <strong>Mark</strong>, <strong>Renjun</strong>, <strong>Jeno</strong>, <strong>Haechan</strong>, <strong>Jaemin</strong>,<strong> Chenle</strong>, and <strong>Jisung</strong> somehow manage to do it without getting way too sentimental.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>We’ve seen the fun hoverboarding and dunking little boys turn into cool teenagers right in front of our eyes, and now they have certainly grown into some fine young men. <em>맛 (Hot Sauce)</em> clearly shows a more matured NCT Dream, but without losing their playful charms. It reminds me of my kiddie years in the ‘90s and my teens in the 2000s while still feeling fresh and new at the same time—a contradiction that a group like <strong>NCT</strong> can somehow manage to make work.<br><br></div><div><br>Overall, the album feels like a warm hug from your best friends. You can feel that they want to have fun with this comeback, which makes <em>맛 (Hot Sauce) </em>a very feel-good and happy album. They seem to be genuinely excited and enjoying themselves with this comeback—which, by the way, is already bringing never-before-seen success to their table. NCT Dream’s first full-length studio album exceeded over 1.7 million sales in pre-order, which is a 243% growth compared to their previous record holding album <em>RELOAD</em>, and it’s already taking over local and global music charts.<br><br></div><h1>DREAM-VERSE Teasers</h1><div><strong><br></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9yfp-zZoNk&amp;ab_channel=NCTDREAM">Chapter #1 The Love Triangle</a> was a peek into “고래 (Dive Into You).” This is the beginning of the storyline where we see an interesting, yet a bit awkward, but still cute and lovely encounter between Jisung and Mark that continues through the rest of the teasers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4JvvjVExw4&amp;ab_channel=NCTDREAM">Chapter #2 The Thing I Cherish</a> was a more emotional peek into “Rainbow (책갈피),” the album’s closing track. Before continuing the story of the eldest and youngest member, in this teaser we see Renjun breaking a cup that somehow shatters into pieces of a plate, which is later revealed to be just Haechan’s weird dream—I’m still wondering what’s the meaning behind this. Seeing the theme of their album, maybe this is an analogy to their friendship feeling like a dream? I’m just guessing here.<br><br></div><div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_zpUIPAydM&amp;ab_channel=NCTDREAM"><br>Chapter #3 The Taste of Pain</a> was a fun play around Mark, Renjun, Jeno, and Jaemin fanboying over their powerful track “Diggity.” Meanwhile Haechan, Chenle, and Jisung just casually dove into the scientific explanation behind our taste buds feeling spiciness (and pain, to continue the romantic storyline), which I really enjoyed because it seemed very natural. I can easily imagine that conversation actually happening between the members. This video showing some energetic dance moves and a lot of charisma straight up made me blush, and I already knew it was going to be a fan-favorite just after the teaser. By the way, NCT member <strong>Doyoung</strong> also mentioned this was one of his favorite tracks during the online press conference that he hosted for the album’s drop.<br><br></div><div><br>The storyline seems to have an open ending, leaving the rest to our imagination—unless everything just referred to how Jisung and Mark started out their friendship in the beginning, then it would all come full circle with the album. Since we are talking about these DREAM-VERSE chapter videos, <strong>SM Entertainment</strong>, if he is also open to it, please bring us back actor Jisung. He deserves a K-Drama lead role.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>Title Track: “맛 (Hot Sauce)”</h1><div><br>“맛 (Hot Sauce)” is a hip-hop song with afrobeat and catchy instrumentals, bringing us some strong guitar chords. It sounds new, fresh, and experimental, which already became a signature move of the neocultural boy group (including all NCT units).<br><br></div><div><br>“맛 (Hot Sauce)” has very high energy, shows confidence, and talks about the various charms of the members. The Korean title, “flavor,” stands for these seven individual flavors that unite in one strong and powerful hot sauce. The song is just as addicting as any hot sauce—you keep craving more for the energy and adrenaline that it gives you. It hypes you up and refreshes you, a great analogy for NCT’s freshest unit that stimulates the listener’s senses in the title track, just like hot sauce stimulates taste buds.<br><br></div><div><br>The track’s signature sound is also very captivating; there’s a little contrast in the song which makes the distinctive vocals and rap stand out even more. Haechan’s high note is definitely one of the highlights of the song, hitting right before the break where we get to appreciate the strong instrumentals. “맛 (Hot Sauce)” has so many killing parts, but I’m sure Jeno’s little ASMR “Pick ma dish” will keep coming back to me everytime I’m trying to figure out what to cook or order. There are a few seemingly sexual references in the lyrics now that the members are all grown-up, but let’s keep this review pure and pretend I don’t hear any. However, the lines could have been a bit differently distributed; this song definitely calls for a lot more Jaemin—but thankfully it evens out more throughout the album.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>As expected, “맛 (Hot Sauce)” makes a very fun and vibrant live stage as we’ve seen during their online comeback show—where I was also obsessed with Chenle’s skirt he wore over his ripped jeans.<br><br></div><h1>The Music Video: “맛 (Hot Sauce)”</h1><div><br>Just like the track itself, the music video for “맛 (Hot Sauce)” is very bright, vibrant, and colorful. If you are looking for a deep plot, this might not be for you, but it makes a very trippy and fun dream that you might have during a food coma caused by a spicy meal. Hot sauces falling from the sky definitely makes for a great business idea, so the boys open up a restaurant which they then, of course, advertise and everything turns into a hot sauce commercial—which proves very effective because I already want to buy it, preferably in seven different flavors.<br><br></div><div><br>At some point we are literally jumping into the hot sauce bottle, and we see how the seven flavors, the 7DREAMs, are becoming the fiery ingredients. In this scene, the members are embracing the real hip-hop elements of the song, both with the retro fire graphics, their cool dance moves, and outfits that seem like a fresh—neocultural, if you like—take on ‘90s hip-hop trends.<br><br></div><div><br>The warm color scheme and the boys’ overall styling bring a little bohemian feel to the video as well. Effects like cool overlays, flames, and sparkles make everything intense and spicy. The simple editing, like zooming in and out or reversing scenes, made the music video fun and exciting, but with the smooth transitions they managed to keep it easy on the eyes.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Once again proving the high anticipation for this comeback, the music video for “맛 (Hot Sauce)” became SM Entertainment’s most viewed video within 24 hours with over 34.2 million views.<br><br></div><div><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/5/12/nct-dream-spiced-up-the-entire-k-pop-world-with-their-seven-different-flavors">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/5/12/nct-dream-spiced-up-the-entire-k-pop-world-with-their-seven-different-flavors</a><br><br></div>',

                'content' => '<div>&nbsp;August 5, 2021 <br><br>With <strong>NCT</strong> growing each year in both popularity and size, they have brought about a unique music style into the K-pop industry. Let’s take a look at some throwbacks of their youngest sub-unit, <strong>NCT Dream</strong>.<br><br><br></div><h1>“Chewing Gum”</h1><div><br>“Chewing Gum” is NCT Dream’s debut song and is as sugary sweet and cute as it can get. The repetitive use of the lyrics “Chew chew chew chew chewing gum” is so addictive and adds to the youthful energy of this song. Chocked full of bright colors and cute edits, the music perfectly fits the song. The most iconic part of this video is their choreography and their incorporation of hoverboards. They were so fluid with the transitions of the hoverboards, you can’t help but be amazed with every dance performance. &nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>“We Go Up”</h1><div><br>Similar to “Chewing Gum,” “We Go Up” has an addictive youthful sound but adds more of a twist to it with its use of hip-hop in this bright song. As this was the final comeback before member <strong>Mark</strong> was about to leave, they added a lot of rap parts into this song and had really smooth transitions into the vocal parts of the song. The music video feels very nostalgic as it shows scenes of summer with fun and was a beautiful send-off for the group to say goodbye to Mark.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h1>“BOOM”</h1><div><br>“BOOM” brings a mature side to NCT Dream and shows the edgy side and is quite spicy compared to their previous comebacks. The beat is immediately addictive and allows the members to truly focus on their vocals for this song with the repetitive lyrics of “Boom boom boom.” The music video adds to the chicness of this song as they use a variety of scenes from parking garages to rococo-styled rooms. It undeniably brought a new side to NCT Dream that will leave you entranced. <br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/8/5/throwback-thursday-a-summer-with-nct-dream">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2021/8/5/throwback-thursday-a-summer-with-nct-dream</a><br><br></div>',

The title track “사랑해 (I Love You)” is a dance pop track that expresses their feelings towards someone they love. The music video is filled with colorful and bright lights that portray the feelings and moods of love. The members are seen dancing with such sharp and precise moves in perfect harmony with each other and the track itself. The best part of the music video is seeing TREASURE having fun and hanging out with each other happily as they are behind the scenes. Also, the special effects of the music video are incredible with the beach waves coming behind them as they dance on stage. <br><br><br> The second track “B.L.T. (Bling Like This)” is another dance pop track that is quite similar to the title track. The track expresses the feelings they have when they see someone they love, saying they are shining and bling in their eyes.

            'content' => '<div>&nbsp;August 10, 2020 <br><br>&nbsp;Competition amongst rookie idol groups is getting more intense by day, especially with the constant K-Pop craze around the globe. Breaking records and sweeping charts, the long-awaited monster rookie group <strong>TREASURE</strong> joins the fierce competition this summer with their debut single <strong>“BOY.”</strong>&nbsp;<br><br> As a newly debuting idol group under one of Korea’s top entertainment companies, an intense level of interest has been and is currently still concentrated towards the team. To say that the boys’ first official step into the music scene was pretty successful is surely an understatement. Building a record of high achievement in their own agency for surpassing 100,000 pre-order sales in the span of two days stands as concrete evidence of TREASURE’s rapidly rising popularity. Furthermore, the group currently trending on YouTube and achieving a grand total of 10 million views in 26 hours of the music video release simply shows the impact of the third-day rookie TREASURE.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><h1>How the Treasures Were Found</h1><div><br>Although the team only debuted this summer, it took two long years for the 12 boys to take their first step into the world.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>TREASURE was a team formed through <em>YG TREASURE BOX</em>, <strong>YG Entertainment</strong>’s audition reality show that aired back in 2018. However, the initial plan for YG’s fourth male group didn’t resemble the current rookie band. With the original debut lineup made up of only 7 members (<strong>Hyunsuk</strong>, <strong>Junkyu</strong>, <strong>Jaehyuk</strong>, <strong>Yedam</strong>, <strong>Haruto</strong>, <strong>Jungwoo</strong>, <strong>Junghwan</strong>), many TREASURE MAKERS––the name of TREASURE fans (also called Teumes for short)––were disheartened by the elimination of a number of talented YG trainees. In response, a new debut lineup group of six members called <strong>MAGNUM</strong> (<strong>Jihoon</strong>, <strong>Yoshi</strong>, <strong>Asahi</strong>, <strong>Mashiho</strong>, <strong>Doyoung</strong>, <strong>Ha</strong> <strong>Yoonbin</strong>) was created. <br><br><br>But a change of plans regarding the two groups was soon announced, notifying the public of Ha Yoonbin’s departure from YG along with the reorganization of TREASURE and MAGNUM into a single 12-member team under the name TREASURE. Although the public has been awaiting TREASURE’s official debut following the grand finale of <em>YG TREASURE BOX</em>, the band never came out into the world in 2019 as promised by the company due to the sudden outbreak of big scale controversies and scandals. Since then, fans were left to wonder about the undisclosed debut date and wait for updates about the indefinitely delayed release.<br><br></div><div><br>Throughout the indeterminate period of time prior to their debut, TREASURE utilized YouTube as one of their main platforms to communicate with fans. The group accompanied and comforted many TREASURE MAKERS with a regular flow of content that allowed fans to discover charms of individual members and team chemistry. By the time TREASURE’s debut date was announced, Teumes were ready to make this long-awaited release the best for the boys.<br><br></div><div><br><br></div><h1>The Start of the Treasure Effect</h1><div><br>Despite their official musical release getting pushed back for what seemed like an infinite amount of time, TREASURE finally came out with their first single album<em> The First Step : Chapter One</em>, consisting of two tracks <a href="https://youtu.be/JSAfPh1A25E">“BOY”</a> and “들어와 (COME TO ME)” (and both instrumentals available only in the physical album). <em>The First Step : Chapter One </em>is the first part of the rookie group’s album series that centers around the stories of the members’ first experiences as young adults and a rookie group in the industry.<br><br></div><div><br>Falling in line with the fresh, youthful vibes of the album as well as the group itself, <em>Chapter One</em> expresses the uncontrollable emotions of a boy who falls in love for the first time.<br><br></div><div><br>The seamless integration of the bass and drum sounds plays a fundamental part in TREASURE’s title track <strong>“BOY,”</strong> creating a definite combination of powerful beats that formulate a steady rhythmic base. Encompassing an energetic and dynamic melodical buildup, the song smoothly proceeds with the guide of its rhythmically active flow and the synthesizer that acts as a catalyst for the escalation of tension in the track. The group’s iconic signature sound, <strong>“shh TREASURE,”</strong> is definitely a contrasting point that accelerates the release of the tension after reaching the climax. It’s a complete mood booster and an essential element to add onto the hype while leaving a lasting impression of the artist’s identity to the listener. Among all, the most elemental part of <strong>“BOY”</strong> is the dance break segment as it exudes a sense of youthful exuberance that perfectly aligns with TREASURE’s fresh concept.<br><br><br></div><div><br>In essence, the music video is a vibrant swirl of colors itself. The intro shows a rolling soccer ball on fire which soon transitions into a dark area that displays lights dramatically turning on to brighten the stage. Standing in the middle of the stage is Bang Yedam, who starts off the song with his melodious vocals. All of the members look dashing and stylish with their varicolored fashion and top-tier looks, and their performance qualities––especially facial expressions and stage presence––are no joke. Inclusion of digital graphic elements throughout the film seem to play a dual role in manifesting as well as enhancing the swirl of emotions that one feels when in love for the first time.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The choreography scenes further exhibit the boys’ confidence that comes with performing; taking advantage of the large number of members, the choreography movements place emphasis on unison, despite the complex sequence, in order to accentuate the charisma and power. The dance break scene led by leader Choi Hyunsuk is captivating as the 12 members perform in unison, playing around with dynamic levels and partnerwork to amplify the team’s energetic aura. Synchronization of the sharp, powerful choreography with a wide variation of formations work side by side, boosting the quality of the dance as well as the impact it leaves on the audience. The mood after the dance break emits party vibes as the music video shows multicolored confetti in the air and clips of members doing acrobatics to hype up the mood. Playful scenes displaying the boys’ quirkiness and lively characters are included throughout the film, directly portraying the youthful vitality of TREASURE.<br><br></div><div><br>To be fairly honest, the pace of the music video seems slightly speedy at some parts, but it doesn’t stand as a bothersome element because it’s understandable that the business is meant to keep up with the song’s dynamic and rhythmic flow. The film is definitely a great way to get to know the rookie group, and who knows if you’ll end up becoming a TREASURE MAKER?<br><br><em><br></em><strong><em>The First Step :</em></strong><em> Chapter One </em>is comprised of an additional song aside from the title track <a href="https://youtu.be/JSAfPh1A25E">“BOY.”</a> Giving a twist from the musical style of their title track, TREASURE’s second song, <a href="https://youtu.be/pDa4e7Rjx-c">“들어와 (COME TO ME),”</a> starts off with a refreshing series of synth sounds that soon yield into a lighthearted, bouncy track. Unlike the straightforward lyrics of confession that “BOY” consists of, “들어와 (COME TO ME)” embraces a melodic flow that represents the boys’ careful, soft, and reassuring approach in asking their upset lover to come back to them. This melodical track provides a nice opportunity to listen to the unique and diverse tones of TREASURE’s vocalists and rappers that perfectly harmonize with one another to embody and exhibit the song’s heart fluttering vibe.<br><br></div><div><br>TREASURE’s original sound in terms of vocalists as well as rappers plays a substantial role in the stylistic aspect of the album. Indeed, the rookie group’s debut album is a great starting point for the boys’ musical career, and the team has so much more potential to unleash through future releases and pursuit of their unique music style. With the virtuosic and versatile individuals that make up the group, and the rookie band’s musical identity in the works, it’s highly anticipated that the TREASURE will go far into their career as one of the leading acts of the fourth generation of the K-Pop industry. Now that the 12 members have finally achieved their dream of debuting, let’s wait and see what TREASURE has in store for us in the future.<br><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/8/10/treasure-sets-off-a-new-global-sensation-with-debut-single-boy?rq=treasure">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/8/10/treasure-sets-off-a-new-global-sensation-with-debut-single-boy?rq=treasure</a><br><br></div>',

And yet, the unexpected announcement of the group’s first English single “Dynamite” came as a shock in the form of the most pleasant and groovy surprise of 2020.<br><br></div><div><br>Aside from their artistry, perhaps the most compelling aspect of BTS as performers is their charisma. Ever since the group’s debut in 2013, these seven boys have brought a breath of fresh air to the K-Pop scene—a sentiment that has only multiplied over time with their newfound global popularity. The group has always been very clear on their stance towards their music: they just want to make people happy. And the disco-infused “Dynamite” does exactly that.<br><br></div><div><br>The boys have had their fair share of funky releases with tracks like “Dope,” “Look here,” “134340,” and every <strong>j-hope </strong>solo, but “Dynamite” takes it to the next level with BTS trying their hand at the disco genre. The song has exactly what you’d expect from a classic disco release, with everything from a catchy running bass line to a bright brass accompaniment to—get ready for it—even a key change. Lyrically, the chorus is one of their most infectious, and it might just be because it’s easily one of their most fun. Just try to hold a straight face while singing “shining through the city with a little funk and soul.” Even if you happen to succeed, the joyful “dynnnnnanana eh” will have you cracking a smile right after.<br><br></div><div><br>2020 has been a rough year for many, and while the joie de vivre of “Dynamite” is healing in itself, the music video for the track is straight-up serotonin. The video opens with a modern-day <strong>Jungkook </strong>dancing by himself in a bedroom before drifting to the other members going about their day-to-day in retro-inspired settings, such as <strong>RM </strong>in a record store. As the song builds and the members come together, the colors begin to brighten in hue, with the boys donning vintage clothing straight out of the ‘70s. By the end of the song, the setting is a bonafide utopia, bursting with color and overflowing with happy vibes.<br><br><br>Disco is an inherently happy genre, and it’s no surprise that the always invigorating boys of BTS pull it off well. In a year when it feels like the sun has forgotten how to shine, it’s good to know that BTS is still here to help light things up.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Check out the video for “Dynamite” below.<br><br></div><h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg">BTS (방탄소년단) \'Dynamite\' Official MV</a></h1><div><br><br>source:<a href="http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/8/24/the-light-2020-needed-btss-dynamite?rq=BTS">http://thekrazemag.com/latest-updates/2020/8/24/the-light-2020-needed-btss-dynamite?rq=BTS</a><br><br></div>',

Jennie is the first of the BLACKPINK members to release her own solo track, and it definitely surpasses expectations. Titled “SOLO,” Jennie brings her smooth vocals and husky rap to the table, perhaps surprising fans with the release.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Based off the teasers alone, fans knew this was going to be a music video aimed at exuding glamor, a love of art, and ferocity. At first, “SOLO” sounds like it would be a pop/R&amp;B song thanks to its light, sweet vibes. But it’s when the chorus comes in with both bass and electro sounds that the song really shines. “SOLO” is definitely something you will have stuck on repeat thanks to its catchy lyrics and sound.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The release is all about being confident and standing on your own. If <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> has “thank u, next” then Jennie has “SOLO,” except it has a spicier, sharper edge to it. Jennie makes it clear that “SOLO” is not a love song, but a breakup song about empowerment. There’s no point in staying in a relationship if there’s no longer a spark, or even feelings, right? Jennie sends the message that you don’t need be in a relationship to be happy, noting that you can confidently stand solo. She directs a message to her ex, claiming that they’re definitely missing out on a great catch and noting that she’s finally moving on without them; she knows she’ll be better off in the long run.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Last but certainly not least, we can’t end this without mentioning all the stops that were pulled for the creation of this music video. Earlier in October, Jennie posted on social media that she was touring Europe, so it comes as no surprise that is where her music video was shot. The setting appears to be a fabulous estate with a lush garden and wide rooms covered in ornate detailing that certainly add to the glamor of the music video. But that’s not all—we simply can’t forget to highlight the stunning outfits she dons throughout, the most notable of which is the flower ensemble seen in the garden, though we also love the blue sequin dress she wears while sitting in the middle of a pool.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Jennie delivers a solid debut and as her first single release, she can only rise from here.
